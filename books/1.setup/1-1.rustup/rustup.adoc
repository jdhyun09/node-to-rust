= Installing rust with `rustup`

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm] (or https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows[nvm-windows]) are indispensible tools. They manage seamlessly installing and switching between versions of node.js on the same system.

The equivalent in Rust's world is https://rustup.rs/[rustup].

Rustup manages your Rust installation as well as additonal targets (like WebAssembly) and core tools like `cargo` (Rust's `npm`), `clippy` (Rust's `eslint`), `rustfmt` (Rust's `prettier`).

After installing `rustup`, run it without any subcommands and explore what it has to offer.

DISCUSSION:
Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official
release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable,
beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes
cross-compiling simpler with binary builds of the standard library
for common platforms.

    If you are new to Rust consider running `rustup doc --book` to
    learn Rust.

`rustup show` will show you what is currently installed.

`rustup completions` will help you enable CLI autocompletion for tools like `rustup` and `cargo`.

`rustup component` lets you add additonal components.

`rustup update` will update you to the latest version.

`rustup install stable|nightly|1.57` will install a specific version or the latest stable/nightly versions.

By default, rustup will install the latest version of `rust` and `cargo` and you should be ready to go right away. Give it a shot with.

## [source,sh]

$ rustc --version
rustc 1.57.0 (59eed8a2a 2021-11-01)

$ cargo --version
cargo 1.56.0 (4ed5d137b 2021-10-04)

If it doesn't work, you may need to restart your shell to update your PATH.

== `rust-toolchain.toml`

Specifying your toolchain with rustup is easy enough. As you get deeper, you may get into configurations where different projects require different toolchains or Rust versions. That's where `rust-toolchain.toml` comes into play. Specify your project's required toolchain, targets, and supporting tools here so that `cargo` and `rustup` can work automagically, e.g.

`toml {title = "rust-toolchain.toml"}
[toolchain]
channel = "1.56.0"
components = [ "rustfmt", "clippy" ]
`
